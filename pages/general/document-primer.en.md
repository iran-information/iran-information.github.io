Statements delivered at UNSC meetings frequently contain references to UNSC documents, IAEA documents, and UN General Assembly documents, etc. This is an overview of some of the UN and IAEA documentation symbols and their online links. 

For more detailed information see: [United Natons Document Series Symbols](https://docs.un.org/en/ST/LIB/SER.B/5/Rev.5) and [Official Doucment System Help Document](https://documents.un.org/assets/ods_help__latest.pdf)

### United Nations Security Council

All UNSC documents begin with "S". The documents referenced are normally from the following catagories:

* Presidential Statments. Symbol S/PRES/YEAR/NUMBER
* General documents, letters, draft resolutions, etc. Symbol S/YEAR/NUMBER
* Resolutions. Symbol S/RES/NUMBER(YEAR)
* Procès-Verbal (Record of meeting). Symbol S/PV.NUMBER

 
To understand the numbering system used, the following fictious examples demonstrate how the number changes when the year rolls over from 31st December to 1st January:

**S/PRES/2024/100**  The president of UNSC files his 100th, and last, Presidential Statement for the year 2024.

**S/PRES/2025/1**  The president of UNSC files his first Presidential Statement for the year 2025.

<br>
**S/2024/1000** The 1000th. and last, UNSC document to be filed for 2024. 

**S/2025/1**  The first UNSC document to be filed for 2025. 

<br>
**S/RES/3000(2024)** The last UNSC resolution for the year 2024.

**S/RES/3001(2025)** The first UNSC resolution for the year 2025.

<br>
**S/PV.10000** is the Procès-Verbal (meeting minutes) of the 10000th meeting of the UNSC. The last meeting for 2024

**S/PV.10001** is the Procès-Verbal (meeting minutes) of the 10001st meeting of the UNSC. The first meeting for 2025.

<br>

### United Nations General Assembly.

All UN General Assembly documents start with the letter "A".  The main difference from UNSC documentation system is that the "Year" is the number of the session of the General Assembly. The sessions are held each year and start in September. In September 2023 the 78th session commenced and continued until September 2024 when the 79th session commenced.

Each year the General Assembly have a main session starting around mid-September, and this is when their "year" rolls over.

In these fictious examples assume the start of the General Assembly session was on 24 September 2023:

**A/78/3000** General document. The last document for 78th session. 23 September 2023

**A/79/1** General document. The first document for the 79th session. 24 September 2023

<br>
**A/RES/78/300** The last resolution of the 78th year of the UN on 23 September 2023.

**A/RES/79/1** The first meeting of the 79th year of the UN on 24 September 2023.

<br>
**A/78/PV.100** The procès-verbal (minutes). The 100th, and last, meeting in the 78th year of the UN. 23 September 2023

**A/79/PV.1** The procès-verbal (minutes). The 1st meeting in the 79th year of the UN on 24 September 2023 

<br>
 
### International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)

The main document from the IAEA are the Board of Governors (GOV) reports and the Information circulars (INFCIRC).

In these fictious examples the year is switching from 31 December 2023 to 1 January 2024

**GOV/2023/100** The 100th report for the year 2023. Published on 31 December 2023.

**GOV/2024/1** The 1st report for the year 2024. Published on 1 Janbuary 2024.

<br>
**INFCIRC/1000** The 1000th Information Circular. Published on 31 December 2023.

**INFCIRC/1001** The 1001st Information Circular. Published on 1 January 2024.

<br> 
  
### Real Scenario

A real scenario highlighting the document naming and online links to the reports generated:


The IAEA inspectors visit Iran and later they return to the IAEA in Vienna. Based on the information the inspectors supply, the IAEA  Director General is responsible for reporting to the IAEA Board of Governors. In this case he delivered two reports:

**GOV/2025/8** 26 February 2025. Derestricted 4 March 2025. Filed at:

<https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/25/03/gov2025-8.pdf>

**GOV/2025/10** 26 February 2025. Derestricted 5 March 2025. Filed at:

<https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/25/03/gov2025-10.pdf>

Iranian officials read these reports. They find there are inaccuracies and write a reply report that highlights what they find is incorrect. They send it to their Iranian representative in Vienna. The representative adds a note verbale and, with the report, they are sent to the Secretariat of IAEA in Vienna. The Secretariat writes a cover letter and the note verbale plus the report are filed as an information circular (INFCIRC) at the IAEA. The Iranian report is:

**INFCIRC/1275** - 4 March 2025. Filed at:

<https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/documents/infcircs/2025/infcirc1275.pdf>


The IAEA GOV/2025/10 report is sent to the President of the UNSC in New York. The President adds a cover letter and the report at the UN is:

**S/2025/155** - 12 March 2025. Filed at: 

<https://docs.un.org/en/S/2025/155>

In this case, various countries considered the report warranted a closed meeting of the UNSC. This was the 9877th meeting of the UNSC held on 12 March 2025. As it was a closed meeting no S/SR or S/RES/ documents were released by the UNSC. The document **S/PV.9877** was released, but it is not the normal procès-verbal, it just explains that the meeting was held in private and does not provide the statements that were made. This document is filed as:

<https://docs.un.org/en/S/PV.9877>

The statement that the Iranian representative delivered at this closed 9877th UNSC meeting on 12 March 2025 was posted on the Iran Ministry of Foreign Affairs website in New York:
