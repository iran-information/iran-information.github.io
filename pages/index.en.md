<!-- title: üè°Ô∏è Iran Information -->

Since 2006 the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has been involved in the Islamic Republic of Iran interaction with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Between 2006 and 2015 six UNSC resolutions were passed as the UNSC tried to influence Iran's nuclear program. 

There can be difficulty in finding the viewpoint of Iran on these matters. This *Iran Information* website provides the statements made by Iranian representatives at these UNSC meetings. [2006 to 2231(2015)](/en/statement/introduction/) contains a transcript of the statement that was delivered for each of the six meetings Iran was permitted to attend between 2006 and 2015. 

UNSC resolution 2231(2015), held on 31 July 2015, extended UNSC involvement in Iran's nuclear program until 10 years after *Adoption day*. This is *Termination day*. It is scheduled for 18 October 2025. After this Iran will continue its nuclear program in conjunction with IAEA monitoring and assistance, but without UNSC resolution constraints.

Since the UNSC resolution was implemented on 31 July 2015, there have been an average of two UNSC meetings each year involving Iran's *non-poliferation*. In December 2018 Iran was permitted to attend and deliver a statement at these meetings. [After 2231(2015)](/en/statement1/introduction1/) are the statements delivered by Iran since December 2018 at the UNSC meetings.


The statements frequently make references to UNSC, UN and IAEA documents. To aid with understanding the symbols and systax of these organisations documentation systems review the [documentation overview](/en/general/document-primer/).
