**Representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran: [Mr. Iravani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Saeid_Iravani)**


At the outset, I would like to express my appreciation to Algeria, China, Pakistan and Russia, which have rejected the politics of coercion and upheld the principles of diplomacy, justice and law. We also commend Guyana for its courage in resisting coercion. Their work today showed true commitment to diplomacy. Their position today sends a clear message: conflict must be resolved through dialogue, not through the blunt instrument of pressure and intimidation. They have chosen to stand on the right side of history.

Iran’s position is clear and consistent. Resolution 2231 (2015) must be implemented exactly as agreed. Its timelines are not suggestions; they are binding commitments, painstakingly negotiated and unanimously endorsed by the Council. Any attempt by the E3 — France, the United Kingdom and Germany — to reimpose sanctions already terminated is not only baseless, but a direct assault on international law and the credibility of the Security Council itself.

Resolution 2231 (2015) and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) were hard-won achievements after more than a decade of negotiations. They settled all concerns about Iran’s nuclear programme, confirming its exclusively peaceful character. Iran implemented the deal in full and in good faith. No other nation has ever subjected itself to such rigorous, intrusive verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We kept our word. The European Union, the E3 and the United States did not. It was the United States that unilaterally tore up the agreement in 2018, reimposing sanctions in open defiance of the Council. It was the E3 that failed to meet its obligation, hiding behind empty promises while quietly following Washington’s lead and instructions. And now, in a striking display of hypocrisy, they claim that Iran must be punished for measures we took only after years of enduring their violations.

We categorically reject the E3 notification of 28 August. It is procedurally invalid, politically motivated and legally void. By bypassing the JCPOA dispute resolution mechanism, the E3 has shredded the very framework it claims to defend. Worse still, parties long in material breach cannot suddenly present themselves as guardians of compliance. That is not legal or lawful. It is opportunism camouflaged as legality. Iran’s remedial measures were neither reckless nor unilateral. They were calibrated, transparent and fully consistent with our rights under the JCPOA. To twist these lawful actions into a pretext for a snapback is to reward violators and punish compliance.

This travesty is unfolding against a backdrop of blatant aggression. Iran’s safeguarded nuclear facilities were attacked— not in secret, but openly by Israel, a rogue regime, and by the United States, a depository of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Facilities under IAEA monitoring were bombed in violation of every principle of international law and the very foundations of the non-proliferation regime. And yet, instead of condemnation, we are witnessing silence, and worse, justification, from the very States now lecturing Iran about obligations. What clearer evidence of double standards and hypocritical behaviour could there be?

Despite this, Iran did not abandon diplomacy. On 9 September, in Cairo, we reached an understanding with the IAEA to resume cooperation — a significant and forward-looking step. But rather than seizing this opportunity, the United States and the E3 dismissed it, exposing the gulf between their rhetoric and their true intentions. They speak of dialogue while strangling it; they proclaim support for diplomacy while burying it under threats. This reckless step undermines dialogue, rewards aggression and sets a dangerous precedent. The E3 and the United States, in coordination with Israel, are spreading false claims that the Iran nuclear programme threatens peace and security. This is a fabrication. Iran has not breached the JCPOA, the NPT or its safeguard obligations. Our nuclear programme remains entirely peaceful.

Even the impartiality of the Council has been compromised. The presidency, under pressure from certain permanent members, ignored the requirement to take into account the views of all participants, including Iran, Russia and China, before presenting today’s draft resolution (S/2025/561). This requirement is explicitly stated in paragraph 11 of resolution 2231 (2015) and even in the President’s draft. Yet, in practice, the President of the Council disregarded this language, violated the neutrality of the Council and effectively endorsed the E3’s notification by both introducing the draft and calling for a vote without ensuring that the positions of China, Iran and Russia, as true participants in the JCPOA, were fully reflected. This was not consensus-building; it was coercion. The result is a decision imposed on the Council, not one owned by it. In conclusion, I wish to state Iran’s firm position.

First, today’s action is hasty, unnecessary and unlawful. Iran recognizes no obligation to implement it.  

Secondly, the responsibility for its grave consequences lies squarely with the United States and the E3, which fabricated allegations against Iran while enabling Israel’s criminal attacks on safeguarded facilities.

Thirdly, this act, for which there was no consensus, weakens the Council, undermines diplomacy and jeopardizes the non-proliferation regime. 

Fourthly, Iran’s nuclear programme will not be destroyed by bombs, halted by sanctions or diverted from its peaceful path. The door to diplomacy is not closed, but it will be Iran, not its adversaries, which will decide with whom and on what basis to engage.

Today the Council has squandered an opportunity for dialogue and consensus. Russia and China, acting in good faith, presented a balanced initiative to extend resolution 2231 (2015) and preserve diplomacy. Instead of embracing this path of reason, the United States and the E3 chose escalation, pressure and division. This contradiction between their rhetoric and actions proves, once more, that their real intention is not diplomacy but escalation. They must now bear full responsibility for the crisis that they have manufactured. Let there be no doubt: Iran will remain steadfast in defending its sovereignty, its rights and the peaceful character of its nuclear programme. We will not yield to coercion. We will not be intimidated by unlawful threats, and we will not allow the Council to be misused as an instrument of injustice.


The meeting rose at 11.25 a.m.
